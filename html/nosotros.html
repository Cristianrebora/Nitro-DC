        This unique group of individuals embodies what Nitro is, a family from all corners of the world. These riders have an endless passion for snowboarding and the snowboard community, everyone is different, but shares the same joy and passion for everything snowboarding. Gold medals, first descents, movie projects, activations, innovations, outliers, trendsetters, sons, daughters, fathers, and future mothers these snowboarders embody what it means to be a snowboarder and they are the reason Nitro is what it is today and what it will be in the future. We strive to support every type of snowboarder because we believe that a snowboarder is a snowboarder the only difference is if they are regular or goofy. We hope these snowboarders inspire and motivate you to go snowboarding and take action as much as they do us every day.
